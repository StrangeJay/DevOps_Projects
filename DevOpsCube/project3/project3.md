# Project 3: Setup Load Balancing for Static Website Using Nignx

This project aims to learn Layer 7 load balancing and load balancing algorithms using Nginx as a Load Balancer.

|S/N | Project Tasks                                                                                              | Key Concepts Covered      |
|----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1  |Deploy three servers                                                                                        | Load balancing            |
| 2  |Set up static websites on two servers using Nginx.                                                          | Load balancing algorithms |
|    |Make a small change in the index.html file of one of the websites to differentiate between two servers.     |                           |
| 3  |Set up Nginx on the third server. It will act as a load balancer.                                           | L7 Load balancing         |
| 4  |Configure Nginx to load and balance traffic between two static websites.                                    |                           |
| 5  |Add the Nginx Load balancer IP to the DNS A record.                                                         |                           |
| 6  |Try accessing the website. Every time you reload the website you should see a different index.html.         |                           |
| 7  |Try different Nginx load-balancing algorithms and options.                                                  |                           |
| 8  |Understand L7 load balancing.                                                                               |                           |
